# Getting a telephone number from users
Getting a telephone number from an user is one of the cases that chatbot is suitable for if done properly. So let's dive into and find best way how to do generate leads that you can use to acquire new customers.

**1. How to gain trust**

From our experience this could be the most tricky part. Users are usually suspectible to giving their phone number to anyone. 

Best practice that we came up with is to design a simple quiz that would capture their interest. To do so try to invent a quiz that will give them some informations that are new or somewhat surprising. Or something that they will realize about themselves. The key is to gain their trust. 

At the same time try to stay in the context of your bot. If you can find a suitable way, you can also ask them about their personal preferences - are they book readers? Pet lovers? Sportsmen? Those small-talk-like questions could also strenghten their feeling of trust. Moreover, you can use those answers to create segments that you can use later.

**2. Tagging users**

At each step of your conversation you can tag users and save their answers into variables. Those answers could be used to write users different answers in the same chatbot or stored for segmentation of your audience for later campaigns or other means of contact.

**3. GDPR agreement**

As most of businesses are operating in the space of European Union you should at some point of the conversation explain users that you will collect and manipulate with their personal data. 

Dedicate one interaction to do so. Best practice to insert a link leading to a page on your website with all legal necesities compliant with european law.

The agreement could have form of explicit consent - clicking on a button.

Or just simply write in the conversation that by continuing, user agrees with collecting and manipulating with his personal data.

**4. Creating actual form**

In the next section you should design the actual form. You should ask all the information that you can possibly use in the future. We suggest those entries:

    - name
    - surname
    - zip code
    - telephone number
    - e-mail address

Smart thing to do is to verify whether the provided entries are valid. You can either show user what he provided and ask him if the data is correct. Or you can verify it with this piece of code.

If user tries to write some nonsense, you could design some funny ways how to respond to a user. Again this could strenghten user's trust to a chatbot.

Another nice thing is to use provided data in a response to a user. It creates more trust and users can be surprised how *smart* the chatbot is.

**5. Sending notification to users that didn't finish the form**

Our experience is showing that some part of users won't finish the form all at once: they got distracted, somebody else could call or text them. 

Wingbot Designer provides a feature with which you can send them a notification. If you are designing a chatbot for Facebook you have to respect its policies - meaning that you can send them only one notification in the 24 hours window after user's last interaction with chatbot.

It is also useful to put breadcrumbs so that user won't start the form from the beginning, but from the interaction that he ended in.
