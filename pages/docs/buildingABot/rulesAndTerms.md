# Rules and terms

## Rules and tips

- **Set low expectations**

  And be ready to deliver more then expected.

- **Don't pretend to be a human**

  It's better, when bot acts like bot - not pretends to be a human.

- **Always lead the dialog**

  There always should be "call to action" in your interaction. Never let user to think long about what to ask bot. You can use **quick replies** as hints.

- **Keep conversation logic simple**

  Simple things works. Not the AI or developers makes your bot smart.

- **Use your visual style**

  User experience will be much better when using media templates.

- **Time is your friend**

  You can always **wait** with your answer.
